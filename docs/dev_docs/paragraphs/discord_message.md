**idk if yall use linux but I do and I hate tar**  

idk about you guys but i dont want to do a combo attack to compress a folder into tar.gz
So I built my own tar managment tool

**RAT (Rust Archive Tool) or tar in reverse**:  
an easy to use tar managment program. This tool recognizes if you are targeting a folder or file and will compress or uncompress accordingly. No more hitting the combo attack "tar -xvzf" to compress a folder.
- Windows support when I'm not lazy :)
---

**Features**
- Super simple commands for compressing and extracting
- No need to remember a million flags
- Fast, safe, and open source (written in Rust :))
